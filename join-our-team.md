<p>Dear Real Estate Agent,</p>

<p>If you’re reading this, you probably feel like you’ve invested a considerable amount of time and energy into your career but have little to show for it. It’s frustrating because, from day one, you’ve had the drive to succeed and, more importantly, to ensure that your clients have an exceptionally positive and gainful home buying or selling experience. </p>

<p>At this point, however, achieving personal and professional fulfillment seems like a remote possibility. Your current business plan isn’t leading you in the right direction, and worse still, your team or brokerage has thrown you in at the deep end without the proper guidance, support, and tools to bring about real progress. </p>

<p>If I’ve perfectly summed up your current situation, it’s because you’re not alone. Tellingly, <strong>87% of first-year agents fail to achieve even mild success and will end up exiting the industry before they reach year two.</strong> Like yourself, many of those agents belong to a team or brokerage deficient in the same areas that yours is and sadly, almost all of them are headed toward a dead end. </p>

<p>You don’t want to continue down that path, so you lie awake at 3 a.m. wondering where your next deal will come from and how you’ll ever get out from under all the debt you’ve amassed. You know that time is of the essence and that if you don’t get things turned around soon, you’ll have no choice but to switch to some 9 to 5 job, where you’ll be forced to forfeit your independence and your dream of some day having your own real estate business. </p>

<p>Fortunately, there’s a way to keep your dream alive, and it starts with joining my team. </p>

<p>Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Leland Titus, and I’ve been serving the Santa Fe market for 14 years. I’ve come a long way, but it’s been anything but easy. I battled through the recession as a young agent while dealing with constantly shifting markets along the way. This has helped me learn not only how to survive through the toughest times, but also how to adapt and flourish. With that knowledge base, I’ve built my own team of 22 agents from the ground up, and together we’ve managed to sell close to 500 homes. </p>

<p>We’d love for you to share in that success. When you join, you’ll quickly learn what it’s like to be a part of a team that offers you clear guidance and support; equips you with hands-on training and systems to clear a path toward success; and empowers you to get ahead without charging you the desk fees that most other brokerages will. Ultimately, our success depends on your success. </p>

<p><strong>More specifically, here’s what I can offer you:  </strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Comprehensive hands-on training</li>
<li>Office space free of charge</li>
<li>Unlimited coaching and support</li>
<li>Your very own website</li>
<li>Access to online transaction-tracking programs</li>
<li>Relief from fees that cut into your profits</li>
</ul></p>

<p>In the end, the decision is yours to make. You can continue to repeat the same mistakes or failed practices over and over until you call it a day and return to the 9-to-5 life. You could also quit here and now and return to the 9-to-5 life. As a third alternative, you could always try your luck at some big-box brokerage, where you’ll pay for rent and the training you receive, putting you at an instant disadvantage. And maybe you’ll be able to get ahold of the qualifying broker every now and then to voice your concerns. No matter which option you go with, you’re sure to be disappointed with the results. </p>

<p>If you’re not convinced that we can steer you toward success, maybe a few stories about the success some current agents of ours have experienced will change your mind. Take Jennifer. After earning her license, she worked for a team that neglected to provide her the professional support she deserved. She knew it was time for a change and decided to join our team. Since then, her business has taken off; she now manages a team and is enjoying the joys of financial freedom and success. </p>

<p>Another agent with a notable success story is Daniel. Daniel worked at Trader Joe’s for five years, and though he loved his time there, he knew it wouldn’t advance his career prospects. With his sights set on real estate, he began interviewing around and found our team to be the most attractive option given his goals. I’m sure he’s glad he did: This year alone, he’s sold more than $3.5 million in volume. Daniel has become an asset to our team, and we couldn’t be happier to see his success. </p>

<p>To sum it up, my offer to you is this: Come over to my team, and we’ll guarantee you better support, hands-on training, lucrative commission splits, and most of all, a family environment with people who will strive to help you succeed. </p>

<p>As soon as you decide this offer is too good to pass up, we’ll get the onboarding process going right away. I’ll meet with you twice a week to track your progress, keep you accountable to your goals, and ensure that you’re taking meaningful steps to achieve them. And once you’ve started to generate business, I’ll be at your side coaching you through the first few deals at every point in the process. </p>

<p>If this sounds like the opportunity of a lifetime, why wait? The longer you do, the longer you deny your potential for greatness. You owe it to yourself to change your career trajectory, and it starts with a single step: to give me a call today. </p>

<p>I look forward to hearing from you very soon! </p>
