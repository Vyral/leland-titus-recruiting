If you’re interested in getting your real estate license, there are a few steps you need to take.&nbsp;

First, **you have to enroll yourself in real estate classes** (I recommend Kaplan Real Estate Education). During this schooling, you’ll have to take 90 hours’ worth of required courses. This usually takes anywhere from one to three months, depending on your lifestyle.&nbsp;

Second, **you need to pass the state and federal real estate exams.** Some people find these exams difficult, but if you study diligently, you should pass. If and when you do pass, you have six months to submit the exams and your application (more on that below). If you don’t do so within this time frame, you have to retake the exams. As often as the rules and regulations change, this is something you don’t want to do.&nbsp;

Next, **you must fill out your New Mexico Real Estate Commission Application.** Along with the application, you’ll need to include a copy of your fingerprints, a credit check, and proof that you’ve passed the exams.&nbsp;

After that, **it’s time to decide which brokerage you want to join.** If you meet with me, I’d be happy to tell you all about our brokerage and how we can give your career the start it needs.&nbsp;

Lastly, **you join the MLS and start training to sell your first home.**&nbsp;

That’s all it takes\! If you’d like to know more about starting your real estate career, I encourage you to attend one of my career nights. If you have any more questions about this topic specifically, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.
