When agents ask me what it takes to be successful in this business, I tell them there really is no clear-cut answer. **However, real estate is a ‘people business,’ and your success ultimately is measured on how many people you can help buy or sell a home.**

I’ve been in the business for a long time and continue to gain new knowledge and clients via referrals from people I’ve helped in the past, and from those who are connected with me on social media. **It’s important to build these different avenues so that people know to look at you as the local expert in real estate.** The quicker you can build up your SOI, database, and network and provide valuable information to them, the better off you will be.

We’re finding that our new agents are getting deals in their first month by doing this. In your first year, you should be able to get enough deals done to survive, and in the end, depending on your level of input and passion, **you can eventually build a great, profitable business this way.**

If you have any questions for me about what a career in real estate looks like or the real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
