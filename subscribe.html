<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Working with Santa Fe Realty Unlimited has been the best decision I have made as a professional adult. My only regret is that I didn't talk to Leland (our qualifying broker) sooner! Ever since joining the SFRU team, I've had more opportunities to make a difference in my community, and realistic chances to grow as a person and be present with my family. Not a day goes by that I'm not thankful to be allied with such a family-oriented and business savvy company. Looking forward to many years to come!" <span class="testimonial-author">- Daniel Huberman</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"I feel like if I had switched companies sooner I would be much further ahead in my career. I always felt like they didn't have time for me, and they certainly didn't offer the kind of training you have provided. SFRU has had such a positive impact on my career, as well as my life. I feel very fortunate to be a part of this family. I need someone to work with me, and show me the right way of doing things. Even though you are very busy, you always make time for all of us. I really appreciate that. Thank you so much!" <span class="testimonial-author">- Rudy Baca</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"As one of the realtors that's been at the office the longest; I've always had questions and problems and I can honestly say that Leland helped me out every time and always fought to defend me while in those situations. He has been completely genuine with the way he runs the brokerage and has influenced your realtors; especially me, because you made it like a family and not like any other mainstream real estate company that sees you as a number." <span class="testimonial-author">- Juan Carlos Mora</span></p>
